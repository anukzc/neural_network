This was a pair programming project for a Machine Learning course. My partner and I implemented a neural network from scratch, only importing argparse and numpy. All functions and helper functions required to train and evaluate a neural network were hand written in the same python file. Hyperparameters are indicated by the user in the command line and accessed with argparse. Other factors, such as whether the problem is classification or regression, if verbose mode is on or off, and the frequency of printing performance to the terminal are also indicated by the user in the command line.
